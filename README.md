This python code I've created is intended to make it easier to modify the Turbowarp source code, which is a fork of Scratch 3.

# Credits

Thanks to the Scratch Team for creating Scratch Gui & Scratch Vm but this code is based on the download of the Turbowarp fork so a big thank you to the original creator of the Turbowarp fork named Thomas Weber (aka: GarboMuffin)
